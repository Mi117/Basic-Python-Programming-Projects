How to use this program:

1. Create a folder/directory where you want to rename files
    Example: Create 'images_to_rename' on your desktop

2. Copy all the files you want to rename into that folder
    
3. Edit the 'path' variable in the code to point to your folder:
    path = "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\images_to_rename\\"
    
4. Run the program
    - All files will be renamed to img0.jpg, img1.jpg, img2.jpg, etc.
    
Note: Make sure you have proper permissions and backup your files before running.
Example path for different OS:
Windows: "C:\\Users\\name\\Desktop\\folder\\"
Mac/Linux: "/home/username/Desktop/folder/

def main():
    i = 0
    path = "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\images_to_rename\\" # Edit this path
    for filename in os.listdir(path):
        my_dest = "img" + str(i) + ".jpg"
        my_source = os.path.join(path, filename)
        my_dest = os.path.join(path, my_dest)
        os.rename(my_source, my_dest)
        i += 1
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

# This program renames all the files in the specified directory to img0.jpg, img1.jpg, img2.jpg, etc.
# Change the file extension/format based upon your necessities
# Enjoy ;)
